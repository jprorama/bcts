# Bookmark Current Tab Set

This is a migration of the excellent XUL/XPCOM 
[bookmark current tab set Firefox extension]( )
to the Webextension model.  The extension
stopped working with the release of Firefox 57 (Quantum)
and the original extension has not yet been ported.
I needed the extension to automatically keep track of tabs 
that I open.

The migration work is occuring on the webex branch.

The current version works but does not have configuration
settings.  My preferred defaults are hard coded.
