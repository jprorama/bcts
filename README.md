# Bookmark Current Tab Set

This is a migration of the excellent XUL/XPCOM 
[bookmark current tab set Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-current-tab-set/)
by [Jake Kasprzak](https://jake.kasprzak.ca/2008/09/26/bookmark-current-tab-set-a-firefox-extension-for-quickly-bookmarking-all-tabs/) to the Webextension model.  The extension
stopped working with the release of Firefox 57 (Quantum)
and the original extension has not yet been ported.

I use the extension to automatically bookmark open tabs
when a window closes. This helps preserve a rich browser history
over long periods of time.

The migration work is occuring on the webex branch.

The current version works but does not have configuration
settings.  My preferred defaults are hard coded.
